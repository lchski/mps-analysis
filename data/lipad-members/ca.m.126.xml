      <pm:biography pm:source="http://dbpedia.org/page/Nina_Grewal">Narinder Kaur "Nina" Grewal, MP (born October 20, 1958), is a Canadian politician of the Conservative Party. She was elected in the general election of June 2004 to represent the constituency of Fleetwood—Port Kells, British Columbia.Grewal was born in Osaka, Japan in 1958. She and her husband lived in Liberia before emigrating to Canada, where she raised her young family while working as a sales manager selling Registered Education Savings Plans. Grewal became an active member of the community and the Reform Party of Canada (subsequently the Canadian Alliance and Conservative Party of Canada), participating in many national and regional conferences and conventions. She is married to former Member of Parliament Gurmant Grewal, and the Grewals were the first married couple in Canadian history to concurrently serve as federal MPs.Grewal is a member of the House of Commons Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Sub-Committee on International Human Rights, and she has served on the Immigration, Canadian Heritage, and Status of Women committees.During her first term, she introduced a private members motion seeking to raise the age of consent. While the then-Liberal government defeated the measure, the subsequent Conservative government put it into law. She also proposed measures to tackle identity theft (with Bill C-271) and to amend the State Immunity Act (Bill C-346), both of which were incorporated into government legislation and subsequently passed. In addition, she pursued bills against child pornography (Bill C-347) and regulations for the volume of television commercials (Bill C-621). The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission later decided to implement her proposals entirely.From May 15–18, 2005, Grewal's husband surreptitiously taped his discussions with the Liberal Party in which he was enticed by the Liberal government officials to crossing the floor to the Liberals in exchange for patronage positions. The Liberals were concerned to save the government during the vote of confidence and had also contacted MPs Chuck Cadman, Inky Mark and Belinda Stronach who had actually crossed the floor and was made an instant minister. When the audio tapes were released, Nina Grewal publicly refused to comment about these discussions but the Grewals had explained in detail to the Parliamentary Ethics Commissioner about the discussions on May 16.On November 29, 2006, it was announced that Nina Grewal would be standing for re-election, even though her husband was not. She successfully defended her seat in the 2006, 2008, and 2011 federal elections.Grewal announced her support for Motion 312, a motion that would have Canada reexamine their definition of when human life begins.</pm:biography>
