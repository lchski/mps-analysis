    <pm:biographies>
      <pm:biography pm:source="http://dbpedia.org/page/Reid_Scott">Reid Scott (born October 23, 1926) is a retired lawyer and provincial judge in Canada, and a former New Democratic Party of Member of Parliament for the Danforth electoral district, in Toronto, from 1962 to 1968, leaving federal politics when his riding disappeared due to redistribution. He had previously served as the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) for the Beaches constituency from 1948 to 1951. He returned to politics in 1969 as a Toronto city alderman.When he was elected to the Ontario legislature in the 1948 provincial election he was the youngest MPP ever at the age of 21. Scott, a law student at the time, defeated 22 year incumbent Thomas Alexander Murphy.Scott played a role in the "Great Flag Debate". Serving on the all-party committee charged with recommending a new flag, Scott successfully lobbied Social Credit and Créditiste MPs to back the Maple Leaf flag as it did not have "symbols of the past". His efforts secured a majority on the committee in favour of what became the new flag.Reid is now the only surviving member of the Parliamentary Committee that selected the design of the new flag. After leaving federal politics, Scott served as a Toronto City Councillor from 1969 to 1976. In the early 1970s, as chair of the Metro Public Works Committee, he proposed turning part of Yonge Street into a pedestrian mall. The experiment was conducted for a week in 1971 attracting 50,000 people a day and then for longer periods during the summers of 1972 and 1973 but was ended due to mounting complaints by businesses about shoplifting and vagrancy.At the age of 80, Scott threatened to come out of political retirement to contest the riding of Ajax—Pickering for the Ontario NDP in the October 2007 provincial election. However, in the end, he did not run in the 2007 election. The NDP candidate for Ajax-Pickering finished third.The next year, Scott announced that he was joining the Liberal Party of Canada because of his admiration of Stéphane Dion as well as the Liberal leader's advocacy of a carbon tax.</pm:biography>
