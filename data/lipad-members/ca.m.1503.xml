His first political activity was in 1992, when he ran a Vote No campaign in the federal riding of Calgary Centre during the Charlottetown Accord constitutional referendum. He then became an area manager for the Reform candidate Jim Silye. During that time he and his family moved to Vancouver Island, where he became involved in the winning campaign of Bob Ringma in 1993. After the election, he was asked to become president of the Nanaimo-Cowichan constituency association for the Reform Party.He was nominated as the Reform candidate in Nanaimo-Cowichan in 1997 and won in that year's federal election.
