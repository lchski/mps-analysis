Maloney worked for the firm of Smith, Shaver, Selzer &amp; McLuskie from 1972 to 1974, operated a private practice in Port Colborne from 1974 to 1976, and has been a partner in Maloney and Maloney from 1976 to the present. In 1980, he was named Port Colborne Citizen of the Year.

On the latter occasion, he defeated Canadian Alliance candidate and future MP Dean Allison by just over 2,000 votes.After further redistribution in 2004, Maloney defeated Greg D'Amico and fellow Liberal MP Tony Tirabassi for the party's nomination in Welland.
