      <pm:biography pm:source="http://dbpedia.org/page/George_Alexander_Drummond">Sir George Alexander Drummond, KCMG CVO (11 October 1829 – 2 February 1910) was a Scottish-Canadian businessman and senator.Born in 1829 at Edinburgh, he was a younger son of the entrepreneurial stonemason, building contractor and city councillor, George Drummond, by his wife Margaret Pringle (b.c.1790). Drummond studied chemistry at Edinburgh University before coming to Montreal in 1854 to work for his brother-in-law, John Redpath, at Redpath Sugar.He married John Redpath's daughter, becoming a co-director of the family business with Peter Redpath, John's son. After the death of his first wife in 1884 he re-married Grace Parker, widow of Rev. George Hamilton (brother of John Hamilton). Lady Drummond served as the first president of the Montreal National Council of Women of Canada (http://www.mcw-cfm.org/history.htm) as well as President and co-founding member of the Women's Canadian Club. She is most famously known for her work with the Red Cross. (http://www.mccord-museum.qc.ca/en/collection/artifacts/M988.98.2)In 1888, he was summoned to the Senate of Canada representing the senatorial division of Kennebec, Quebec. He served until his death in 1910. From 1887 to 1896, he was a vice-president at the Bank of Montreal and served as its president first as the de facto from 1897 and official starting in 1905.He helped found the St. Margaret's Home for Incurables in 1894, purchasing the house that had previously been built for Sir William Collis Meredith. As a member of the Citizen's League he sought to improve life in Montreal and he served as president of the Royal Edward Institute, a dispensary for the prevention of tuberculosis, founded in 1909 by Jeffrey Hale Burland (1861–1914). His recreations were mirrored in other positions he held, the first president of the Royal Canadian Golf Association (1895) and president of the Art Association of Montreal.He was made a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1904 and a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order in 1908. He and his wife built a house in Montreal's Golden Square Mile, and kept a summer home (Gads Hill) at Cacouna and an estate, Huntlywood, which is now known as Beaconsfield, where they raised pure-breds and kept a private golf course for their friends. He and his family lived on Sherbrooke Street in Montreal's Golden Square Mile. He is buried in Mount Royal Cemetery.</pm:biography>
