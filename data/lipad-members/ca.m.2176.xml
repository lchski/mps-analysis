      <pm:biography pm:source="http://dbpedia.org/page/James_J._Donnelly">James J. Donnelly (born November 14, 1866), was appointed to the Canadian Senate for life by Prime Minister Robert Laird Borden May 26, 1913 to represent the senatorial division for Bruce South, Ontario. He was the youngest Senator chosen at that time. With more than 40 years of political experience, Senator Donnelly died at the home he built in Pinkerton on October 20, 1948 at the age of 81, approximately one and one half miles from where he was born. His wife died on December 30, 1960 at the age of 89. James J. Donnelly had the occupation as a lumberman, president / manager, and rancher. Prior to the Canadian Senate, James J. Donnelly was the Reeve and Clerk for the Township of Greenock, Ontario and Warden of Bruce County in 1902. Senator Donnelly bought 2,800 acres (11 km2) and his family ran a lumber mill out of Chepstow. He also raised beef cattle.In 1895 James J. Donnelly married Julia Mcnab, the daughter of Michael Mcnab and Magdalena Brohman of Chepstow and took over the old homestead from his parents who retired to Kingsbridge. However he soon became interested in the lumbering business and bought a large section of the Greenock Swamp from W. D. Cargill. So he moved with his young family to the nearby village of Pinkerton where in 1904 he built a spacious white brick residence.Early in life James embarked on a political career. After being elected Reeve of Greenock Township, he was chosen as Warden of Bruce County in 1902. In 1904, he was elected as a Conservative member of Parliament for the Riding of East Bruce in the by-election which followed the death of W. D. Cargill. He was defeated in the 1904 federal election later that year in Bruce South but won the riding in the 1908 and 1911 elections. His eldest son, Frank, followed his father's example of public service and was a Justice of the Supreme Court of Ontario. His son Jim of Goderich, in turn, now holds that position. The youngest son, Harold, like his father was Warden of Bruce and his son Maurice later held this position, thus setting a record of three generations as Wardens of Bruce. Mertis, his second born, was a teacher of mathematics and married William Flannery, a North Bay lawyer in 1932. For her achievements in Community Service during World War II, she was named a member of the Order of the British Empire by George VI in 1946.</pm:biography>
