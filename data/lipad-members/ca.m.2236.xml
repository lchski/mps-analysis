The same year, with his parents, Zotique and Ida Richer La Flèche, Léo moved to Sorel, Quebec, because of his father's work in Ottawa with the government for the civil service. Léo served with the 22nd Battalion, CEF, during World War I as a captain and major. In 1917, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order and the Légion d'honneur of France. He later became a lieutenant-colonel commanding the District Depot No. 4, Montreal. He would achieve the rank of major general.

He defeated Jean Drapeau, future mayor of Montreal. This same fall, Prime minister Mackenzie King named him Minister of National War Services, a post he kept until he became the first Canadian ambassador to Greece on April 17, 1945.He was the Canadian ambassador to Greece from 1945 to 1949. On October 20, 1949, he presented his credentials to the governor general of Australia as the new high commissioner of Canada.
