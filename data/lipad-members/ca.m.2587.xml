      <pm:biography pm:source="http://dbpedia.org/page/Donald_MacBeth_Kennedy">Donald MacBeth Kennedy (born: August 21, 1884 Ballinlaig, Perthshire, Scotland - died: September 25, 1957) was a farmer as well as a provincial and federal level Canadian politician. Kennedy ran for the United Farmers of Alberta in the 1921 Alberta general election. He defeated Liberal incumbent William Rae in a landslide. Kennedy resigned his seat to provide a seat for Herbert Greenfield who was appointed to the cabinet in the United Farmers government. Kennedy ran for a seat in the Canadian House of Commons in the 1921 Canadian federal election held months later in the federal electoral district of Edmonton West as a candidate for the Progressive Party of Canada he defeated former Liberal Member of Parliament Frank Oliver and former Conservative MLA Robert Campbell to win his first term in office.Kennedy would switch to the new Peace River district in the 1925 Canadian federal election. He would go up against William Rae whom he had previously defeated, and Conservative candidate James Arthur Collins. The race would end up in a virtual 3 way tie with Kennedy coming out on top, the spread in the margin of votes between 1st and 3rd was a total of 42 votes.A year later he would run again in the 1926 Canadian federal election this time running under the United Farmers of Alberta banner. He would defeat Mayor of Edmonton Joseph Clarke and James Arthur Collins again by a much larger margin then the election a year ago.Kennedy would run for a 4th term in the House of Commons in the 1930 Canadian federal election. He would defeat Liberal candidate John Ewing Thompson by a comfortable margin. He was defeated in his bid for a 5th term in office this time running under the Co-operative Commonwealth banner finishing 3rd in a place of 4 candidates to Social Credit Party of Canada candidate Ren√©-Antoine Pelletier. In parliament, Kennedy joined the Ginger Group of radical MPs in the 1920s.</pm:biography>
