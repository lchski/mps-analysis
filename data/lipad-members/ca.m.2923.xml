      <pm:biography pm:source="http://dbpedia.org/page/Jeremy_Harrison">Jeremy Harrison, (born January 29, 1978) is a Canadian politician, currently representing the riding of Meadow Lake in the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan. Harrison is also the former Canadian Member of Parliament for the riding of Desnethé—Missinippi—Churchill River, a riding that encompasses the northern half of the province of Saskatchewan.Born in Saskatoon, Harrison joined the Reform Party in 1996 and served in numerous positions in Reform, the Canadian Alliance, and the Conservative Party of Canada, including time as a political staffer in the Office of the Leader of the Opposition in Ottawa. He worked for Stephen Harper's leadership campaign in 2002, and from 2002 to 2004 he served on the national executive of the Canadian Alliance. During this time Harrison was also enrolled at the University of Saskatchewan College of Law. He graduated from that institution with a Bachelor of Law degree in the spring of 2004. He later graduated with a Master's in Public Administration from the Johnson Shoyama Graduate School of Public Policy.He was elected to Parliament as a Conservative in the 2004 federal election. Harrison was defeated in the 2006 federal election by Liberal opponent Gary Merasty. On election night, the margin was 109 votes. He challenged the result, alleging threats and ballot stuffing by the Liberals, but a judicial recount confirmed Merasty's victory, by a reduced margin of 67 votes. On February 20, Harrison announced that he would not pursue the matter further.Subsequent to the 2006 election Harrison served as a senior official in the Conservative government.Harrison has been cited as being part of the Conservative Party of Canada's alleged In-and-Out scheme during the 2006 election.Harrison was acclaimed as the Saskatchewan Party's candidate in Meadow Lake in June 2007.He was initially declared defeated in the 2007 election, narrowly losing to incumbent MLA Maynard Sonntag in Meadow Lake, but was subsequently declared elected after a count error was noted the following day. The count of absentee ballots on November 19 confirmed Harrison's victory.On May 29, 2009, he was appointed Minister of Municipal Affairs by Premier Brad Wall.On June 29, 2010, he was appointed Minister of Enterprise Saskatchewan and Minister Responsible for Trade.On December 5, 2011, after winning re-election on November 7, he was also appointed as Government House Leader.</pm:biography>
