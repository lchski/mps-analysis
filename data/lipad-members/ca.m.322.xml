    <pm:biographies>
      <pm:biography pm:source="http://dbpedia.org/page/Allan_Pietz">Allan Ernest Pietz (born 18 June 1925 in Welland, Ontario) was a Progressive Conservative party member of the Canadian House of Commons. He was a businessman and dairy operator by career. He held a series of elected municipal offices in the former Crowland Township before he was elected mayor of Welland in 1965. He held office until 1978, when he did not run for re-election for mayor. He was succeeded by Eugene Stranges. In 1981, he was elected as a Niagara Regional Councillor from Welland. After several unsuccessful attempts to enter national politics at the Welland riding in the 1958, 1962 and 1979 federal elections, he won the riding in the 1984 federal election, defeating Liberal incumbent Gilbert Parent. Pietz only served one term, during the 33rd Canadian Parliament, as he was defeated in the 1988 federal election at the reorganized Welland—St. Catharines—Thorold riding by Parent.He made a political comeback in 1991 when he was again elected as a Niagara Regional Councillor for Welland. Shortly afterward, he ran for the Chairmanship of the Niagara Regional Council, but was defeated by Brian Merritt. He did not seek re-election in 1994 and has since retired from political life.</pm:biography>
