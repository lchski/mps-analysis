      <pm:biography pm:source="http://dbpedia.org/page/Dennis_Gruending">Dennis Gruending (born May 18, 1948 in St. Benedict, Saskatchewan) is a Canadian journalist and politician. He is primarily a writer of non-fiction, but also published a book of poetry and various pieces of short fiction. He is a journalist who has worked for three newspapers and for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation as a radio host, radio producer, and television reporter. He was elected to Parliament as a New Democratic Party candidate in a 1999 by-election in the riding of Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar, following the resignation of Chris Axworthy. However, he lost to Carol Skelton of the Canadian Alliance in the 2000 electionGreuending's 1999 Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar by-election campaign came under intense scrutiny from Reform Party candidate Jim McAllister. On one occasion, McAllister, along with a handful of reporters drove to the Gruending home in Saskatoon's north end where McAllister referred to Gruending as a "parachute candidate". To add insult to injury, McAllister showed the media photos of the Gruending home in Ottawa, an oxygen mask because McAllister said that Eastern Canadian residents often complained about the air quality, and a detailed map of the Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar riding where McAllister claimed he was the only candidate who actually lived in the riding. Gruending, ended up with the last laugh, defeating both McAllister and Saskatoon mayor Henry Dayday, who was running for the Liberal Party.[citation needed]In the 2004 election, Gruending ran again in Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar, but lost. Gruending has written five books, including biographies of former Saskatchewan premier Allan Blakeney, and another of Supreme Court of Canada Justice Emmett Hall. Gruending's latest book, Great Canadian Speeches was published in 2004 and was a Canadian best seller.</pm:biography>
