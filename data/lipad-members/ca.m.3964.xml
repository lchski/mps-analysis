    <pm:biographies>
      <pm:biography pm:source="http://dbpedia.org/page/Colin_Kenny">James Colin Ramsey Kenny (born December 10, 1943) is a Canadian Senator.Born in Montreal, Quebec, Kenny received his high school education at Bishop's College School. He received a Bachelor of Science degree in 1966 from Norwich University. In 1967, he received a Public Service Fellowship from the Tuck School of Business.Kenny's political career began in 1968 when he served as executive director of the Liberal Party of Canada in Ontario. He was on the staff of the Prime Minister's Office from 1970 until 1979, and rose to the position of policy advisor and assistant Principal Secretary to Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. Following the Liberal government's defeat in the 1979 election, he worked as an executive with Dome Petroleum, until being appointed to the Senate on the recommendation of Trudeau in 1984. As a member of the Upper House, Kenny has been active in writing anti-smoking legislation and legislation encouraging the use of alternative fuels. He has also represented Canada as a delegate to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. While serving as Chair of the Standing Senate Committee on National Security and Defence (SCONSAD), the committee has seen more witnesses, spent more hours in committee, and released more reports than any other Senate committee. The SCONSAD reports examine areas of national security and defence, including airports, seaports, border crossings, coasts, Emergency Preparedness, and the Canadian Forces. Kenny gained national spotlight with a YouTube video of the Senate Defence Committee where several heated arguments occurred in committee when the meeting was disrupted repetitively by Senators choosing not to follow rules.He is also a member of the Trilateral CommissionKenny withdrew from the Liberal caucus on November 21, 2013 pending the outcome of an investigation into sexual harassment charges against him by his former assistant.</pm:biography>
