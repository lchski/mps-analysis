      <pm:biography pm:source="http://dbpedia.org/page/Alexander_Warburton">Alexander Bannerman Warburton (April 5, 1852 â€“ January 14, 1929) was a politician, jurist and author, who served as the seventh Premier of Prince Edward Island, Canada.Alexander was born in Summerside, the son of James Warburton, who was a member of the provincial assembly. Named after Lieut. Governor, Sir Alexander Bannerman, he was educated in Summerside, at St. Dunstan's College, King's College in Nova Scotia and the University of Edinburgh. He was called to the bar in 1879. He was a director for the Patriot Publishing Company and the Eastern Assurance Company of Canada.Warburton was first elected to the province's House of Assembly in 1893 as a Liberal, and was re-elected in 1897. He became premier of the province on October 27, 1897 when his predecessor resigned to move to British Columbia. Warburton only served in the position for eight months until resigning in June 1898 to accept a judicial appointment.In the 1908 federal election, he was elected to the Canadian House of Commons as a Liberal Member of Parliament (MP), but lost his seat in the 1911 election that defeated the Laurier Liberals. He attempted to return to the House but was again defeated in the 1917 election. In 1920, Warburton returned to the bench as a judge on probate court and held that position until his death.Warburton wrote two books on the history of the island, Prince Edward Island, Past and Present in 1905, and A History of Prince Edward Island which was published posthumously in 1923. Prior to entering politics, Warburton started a movement to beautify Charlottetown which resulting in the planting of more than 800 trees along main thoroughfares and in public squares, many of which stand to this day.</pm:biography>
