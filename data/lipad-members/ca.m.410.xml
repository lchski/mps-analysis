      <pm:biography pm:source="http://dbpedia.org/page/Patrick_Brown_(politician)">Patrick W. Brown (born May 26, 1978 in Toronto, Ontario) is a Canadian lawyer and politician affiliated with the Conservative Party of Canada. In 2006, Brown was elected to serve in the Canadian parliament representing the riding of Barrie. Brown defeated Aileen Carroll, the incumbent Liberal MP and cabinet minister, in a re-match of the 2004 election in which he had been defeated.Brown was the Deputy Chairman of the International Young Democrat Union (IYDU). He has also represented Canada on a number of international assistance projects hosted by the IYDU.Brown served two terms as President of the Progressive Conservative Youth Federation (PCYF) from 1998 to 2002. He also served on the executive of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario, as a Vice President.As PCYF President, Brown was one of the early supporters of a united right and drew criticism for his decision to support a united right from party leader Joe Clark and Member of Parliament Scott Brison. Nonetheless, Brown was later re-elected as PCYF president with 81 percent of the vote against Jonathan Frate of Manitoba.Brown graduated from St. Michael's College School and then went on to study political science at the University of Toronto. He then graduated with a law degree from the University of Windsor.During his second year at law school, he was one of 10 recipients of the prestigious As Prime Minister Awards. He also worked for Magna International in their legal department over a period of four years. Brown was elected to the city of Barrie council in 2000 at age 22, defeating the incumbent councillor. He was re-elected in 2003 with 72 percent of the vote, the largest margin of victory in the city that year.Brown was re-elected to parliament in the 2008 election by a large margin, more than double that of the next candidate. He defeated the relatively unknown, newcomer Liberal candidate, Rick Jones, by 15,195 votes. Liberal leader St√©phane Dion was immediately blamed for a substantially weaker Liberal showing at the polls across the country, which may have contributed to this wide margin.In the 2011 election, Brown was elected to his third term in office by a wide margin.Brown announced that Southmedic Inc. will receive a contribution of up to $900,000, opening up 18 full-time jobs in the Barrie area, saying "The investment will allow Southmedic to innovate, compete, and further establish itself as a leader in the medical sector... The sector has increased steadily since 2000. Southmedic has been at the focal point of this growth."</pm:biography>
