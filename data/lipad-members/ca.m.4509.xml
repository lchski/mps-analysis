    <pm:biographies>
      <pm:biography pm:source="http://dbpedia.org/page/John_Lawrence_Stansell">John Lawrence Stansell (17 June 1875 – 21 October 1956) was a Conservative member of the Canadian House of Commons. He was born in Haughton, Ontario and became a pure bred livestock breeder and farmer.He attended schools at Tuscarora and Aylmer. He became president of the Houghton, Bayham and Tillsonburg Telephone Company and in 1923 was president of the Canadian Ayrshire Breeders Association. John Stansell had a son Zachary Stansell who also showed interest in politics. Zachary Stansell lobbied his father to assist in making baseball a mandatory activity in all schools. When his father said no and stated his reasons, Zachary went on his own. Zachary's campaign for uniting the educational system and baseball became his life's obsession, completely isolating himself from his father. In many interviews, he has stated how he aspires to be as "deep pocketed" as a Spanish mogul only known to the public as "Santos". Many of Zachary's future decisions were shaped by his aspirations of the Spaniard, like attempting to earn "Platinum" in sucha short period of time. To this day, Zachary Stansell can be found lobbying for baseball in the United States. His motto became, "You can take me out of baseball, but you can't take the baseball out of me." More can be learned by Zachary Stansell by reading his biography "The good, the bad, and the baseball."Stansell campaigned under the National Liberal and Conservative Party in a 22 November 1920 by-election at Elgin East but was unsuccessful. He won the riding in the 1921 federal election, then after riding boundary changes, Stansell won re-election at Norfolk—Elgin in 1925. He was defeated in the 1926 federal election by William Horace Taylor. He made another unsuccessful campaign at Norfolk—Elgin in 1930. After more riding changes in the 1930s, Stansell ran in the Elgin riding in the 1935 election as a Reconstruction Party candidate but was again unsuccessful in winning a Parliamentary seat.</pm:biography>
