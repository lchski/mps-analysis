    <pm:biographies>
      <pm:biography pm:source="http://dbpedia.org/page/Blair_Wilson">Blair Wilson (born May 18, 1963 in North Vancouver, British Columbia) was the Canadian Member of Parliament (MP) in the 39th Canadian parliament for West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast—Sea to Sky Country electoral district. He was elected on January 23, 2006 in the 2006 federal election as the Liberal candidate. Shortly before the 2008 election was called, Wilson changed his allegiance to the Green Party of Canada, becoming that party's first MP following a period sitting as an Independent. He subsequently lost the election to Conservative John Weston.Wilson is a chartered accountant who lives in West Vancouver. He holds a bachelor's degree in political science from the University of Victoria.In the 2006 election, Wilson narrowly defeated John Weston, the Conservative Party candidate. Weston lost by 1.5%, or 976 votes. Wilson became involved in politics as the organizer for "The 2010 Rally on Robson", an event held in support of the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver during the City of Vancouver's plebiscite. He stood for Parliament in the 2004 federal election, narrowly losing to John Reynolds by 1687 votes in what the Conservative Party had considered a safe seat. At one point the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation had declared Wilson the winner. However, when some of the more rural results came in, Reynolds won.On July 21, 2008 Elections Canada cleared Wilson of 21 of the 24 allegations raised by The Province's investigation. Wilson requested readmittance to the Liberal caucus in July 2008 but was not allowed to rejoin the party. It was announced on August 30, 2008 that he had joined the Green Party of Canada as that party's first Member of Parliament, although Parliament was dissolved before he could sit as a Green Party MP. He unsuccessfully ran for re-election as a Green Party representative.</pm:biography>
