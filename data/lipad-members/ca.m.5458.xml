After graduating high school, he pursued an undergraduate and graduate degree in political science from Dalhousie University. After graduation he went to work for a local radio station in Halifax. He was married to Lorraine Ware and had six children.In the 1953 federal election, Morris made his first attempt into politics when he ran as the Progressive Conservative candidate in the electoral district of Halifax. Although he lost, he continued to be involved in politics at the local level, and offered himself for election again in the 1957 election, in which he was elected to the House of Commons of Canada.Between 1957 and 1963, Morris represented the riding of Halifax in the House of Commons. He held the positions of Parliamentary Secretary to the Postmaster General, and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Commerce.In 1963, Morris was appointed as chief assistant to the President of Saint Mary's University in Halifax, Nova Scotia.

Morris served as Interim President of Saint Mary's University during the school year 1970–1971.Between 1974 and 1980, Morris served as Mayor of the City of Halifax.After stepping down as Mayor of Halifax, Morris, entered provincial politics by standing as the Progressive Conservative candidate in the urban riding of Halifax Needham, during a by-election, on 6 May 1980.
