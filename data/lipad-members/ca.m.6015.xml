      <pm:biography pm:source="http://dbpedia.org/page/Donald_Stovel_Macdonald">Donald Stovel Macdonald, PC, CC (born March 1, 1932) is a former Canadian Liberal politician and Cabinet minister. Macdonald graduated from the University of Trinity College in the University of Toronto in 1952. He attended Harvard Law School, LLM, the University of Cambridge, England, Diploma in International Law. (He was first elected to the Canadian House of Commons in the 1962 election as the Liberal Member of Parliament for Rosedale riding in Toronto. In 1967, he was the parliamentary secretary of Paul Martin, Secretary of State for External Affairs. He joined the Cabinet of Pierre Trudeau in 1968 and served as President of the Privy Council, Minister of National Defence, Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources and Minister of Finance. As Finance Minister, Macdonald introduced wage and price controls in an attempt to control inflation. Macdonald resigned from Cabinet in 1977 to return to his law practice. When Pierre Trudeau announced his resignation as leader of the Liberal Party of Canada following his defeat in the 1979 election, Macdonald would have declared his candidacy for the position. However, with the unexpected defeat of Joe Clark's Progressive Conservative government on a motion of no confidence, the Liberals asked Trudeau to lead them into the 1980 election and cancelled the leadership campaign. Macdonald was not a candidate for the party leadership when Trudeau again resigned in 1984. In 1982, Prime Minister Trudeau appointed Macdonald chairman of a Royal Commission on the Economic Union and Development Prospects for Canada. The report was released in September 1985, and recommended, among other things, that Canada enter a free trade agreement with the United States. Progressive Conservative Brian Mulroney was Prime Minister by this time. He accepted the recommendation, and pursued what became the Canada-US Free Trade Agreement. Macdonald was appointed High Commissioner to the United Kingdom in 1988. He held that position until 1991 when he returned to his law practice in Toronto. In 1994, he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada.He holds honorary degrees from: The Colorado School of Mines, The University of New Brunswick, the University of Carleton, The University of Toronto, Doctor of Sacred Letters, Trinity College, University of Toronto. He is a former member of the Steering Committee of the Bilderberg Group.Macdonald married Ruth Hutchison, (dec.) in 1961: daughters Leigh, Nikki, Althea, Sonja. Married Adrian Merchant Lang in 1988: Maria (dec), Timothy, Gregory, Andrew, Elisabeth, Amanda, Adrian.They have fifteen grandchildren.</pm:biography>
