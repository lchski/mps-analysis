    <pm:biographies>
      <pm:biography pm:source="http://dbpedia.org/page/Thomas_Michael_McMillan">Thomas Michael "Tom" McMillan, PC (born October 15, 1945) in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, Canada is a Canadian political scientist and former politician. McMillan was first elected to the Canadian House of Commons in the 1979 general election as the Progressive Conservative Member of Parliament for Hillsborough, Prince Edward Island. He was re-elected in the 1980 and 1984 elections. He served as Deputy House Leader from 1983 to 1984 under Leader of the Opposition Brian Mulroney. Following the Tory landslide in the 1984 general election, Mulroney appointed McMillan to Cabinet as Minister of State for tourism. A year later, McMillan was named Minister of the Environment, replacing the controversial Suzanne Blais-Grenier. McMillan maintained a much lower profile than his predecessor. He was concerned with emerging issues of the 1980's like acid rain, and remained active in local issues and heritage preservation. When in 1981 an historic bank building in his riding was demolished there was an outcry from concerned citizens, including McMillan. He summed up the loss of this historic structure, "The actions of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in Charlottetown have been decidedly more imperial than Canadian." He became increasingly active in preservation causes including the restoration of a brick powder magazine located in Brighton Compound in Charlottetown.McMillan remained Environment minister until he was defeated in the 1988 general election due to opposition to the Canada-US Free Trade Agreement among his constituents. He maintained his involvement in politics, and attempted unsuccessfully to regain his seat in the 1993 general election. He again attempted a comeback in the 1997 general election, this time in the riding of Peterborough, Ontario, but came in third place behind Liberal candidate Peter Adams and the Reform Party's Nancy Branscombe.</pm:biography>
