    <pm:biographies>
      <pm:biography pm:source="http://dbpedia.org/page/Pauline_Browes">Pauline Browes, PC (born May 7, 1938) is a Canadian politician. She was a Member of Parliament between 1984 and 1993. An educator by training, Browes was first elected to the Canadian House of Commons as the Progressive Conservative Member of Parliament for Scarborough Centre in the 1984 federal election that brought Brian Mulroney to power. She served as parliamentary secretary to the Minister of the Environment from 1986 to 1989, and as parliamentary secretary to both the Secretary of State for Canada and the Minister of State for multiculturalism and citizenship from 1989 until 1991. In that year, she was appointed to the Mulroney Cabinet as Minister of State for the Environment. In January 1993, she was moved to the position of Minister of State for Employment and Immigration. When Kim Campbell succeeded Mulroney as PC leader and Prime Minister of Canada in June 1993, she promoted Browes to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development. However, in the subsequent 1993 federal election, the Campbell government was defeated, as was Browes in her riding of Scarborough Centre. During the 1995 Ontario provincial election, she served as a special advisor to Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario election campaign won by Mike Harris, who became Premier of Ontario. Harris subsequently appointed her Vice Chair of the Ontario Environmental Review Tribunal.On April 20, 2005, the National Post reported that Browes had been recruited by the Conservative Party of Canada as one of their star candidates in the 2006 federal election. She ran in the riding of Scarboroughâ€”Guildwood, but failed to get elected, finishing second with 11,790 votes (28.7%).</pm:biography>
